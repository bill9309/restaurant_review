So, The Fat Greek was a pleasant discovery one weekend when i was strolling in a shopping center during lunch time.  It's not cozy, it's decorated in traditional blue and white, with some grapes here and there, but once you sit down you realize....you're here to eat.
The Fat Greek is family owned and operated....and they are so happy to help you choose  something wonderful from their menu.  I recommend a bottle or two of Mythos beer, (oh yeah, they have a full bar. OPA!) and the beef kabob, with a appetizer of their homemade Hummus and fresh pita's.  WORD to the taste buds."
1,"been to the fat greek several times, most recently for din din tonite with the gf.
ordered the usual starters - hummus and stuffed grape leaves - enjoyed both.
gf went with the standard gyro, i tried the lamb shanks with orzo.  total price with drinks $35.  unfortunately, due to time constraints, after the apps and the soup that came with my dinner, we had to take the rest to go.  btw - the soup, a chicken and rice with dill and a little citrus-y tang was delicious !
after dropping the gf off at work, made it home for the shanks - 2 huge chunks of lamb and a big 'ol pile of orzo.  the lamb meat - tender and plenty of meat on dem bones !!  only prob - didn't  have anything to scoop out the gold in them thar shanks - actually used a toothpick !
surprised to see a little italian cafe next to FAt Greek - one more place to try !
happy eating !"
2,"So. This is the next best thing to my mommy's home cooking [which is currently 500+mi away :(]. Souflaki (lamb shish kabob) was soooo good! They cooked it exactly how I asked. The fries that come with it would super good for some reason...pretty sure fries aren't a Greek specialty haha. Tiropitas (cheese pies) were pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but I'm too lazy to cook I'll definitely pop in here for a couple orders! Service was good. Casual dining but good food and reasonable prices."
3,"WoW!
I've been a #1 fan of Greek food years, and when I crave it in Vegas, this is where I end up... First couple of times I was amazed @ the fresh taste, but couldn't understand the wait.. I peeked in the kitchen to see them chopping the parsley for my tabouli...""Could they be making it fresh evertime?"" You bet'cha! and the prices are very reasonable, staff is amazing.
Don't miss it!!

4,"great food, even better customer service! p.s. the lamb is awesome!!!"
5,"I'm updating to improve my review to 4 stars.  They've expanded the restaurant and improved the service.  Food is still great.  Best Greek food I've had in a long time.
Good food, especially the gyros.  Greek salad was made with great olive oil and the flavor really improves the dish, especially compared to the vinagrette they put on at most Greek restaurants."
6,"This place was packed with a wait at lunch time - definitely a great sign! Service was friendly and prices were decent.
Gyro Supreme - $6.75 or so (add $1.75 for drink + fries/rice). Great gyro meat, soft warm pita bread and tons of feta and tzatziki sauce! I've actually never had a gyro with feta cheese - but it was a welcome addition !"
7,"I stumbled upon this place on my way to the airport.  What a pleasant suprise!
I got there around 11:00 am and there was only one table available.  Within minutes there was a line out the door.  I ordered something safe - gyro with french fries.  I was disappointed with myself when I saw the entrees and salads being served to the other table.  In a few minutes I received my order and I was impressed.  The meat was tender yet crispy on the outside, the pita was soft, the sause was exactly what it should be and the french fries were delicious.
If I lived in Vegas I would eat here at least once a week.  Oh, and the prices are great!"
8,"Yelp to the rescue, once again!!  This place is an AWESOME off-the-strip find.  High quality, delicious food for really reasonable (almost cheap) prices.  We went in the afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, so we had excellent service.  It's in a strip mall, but nicely decorated in the standard blue and white Greek style.  A huge menu, lots of options and you get sides with most of the dishes (a plus for me).  I had the flatbread sandwich with veggies, feta, and tzatziki, and my pal had the gyros and fries.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  I wish we had a Greek place this cheap and good in LA!"
9,"Great place, reasonably priced the food was really good everything was fresh and the restaurant was spotless."
10,"Yay YELP! Came here based on other reviews, and had a great meal, well, meals!
Way better than your average Greek place. Had a delicious gyro for lunch. The fries were amazing also. Liked it so much I went back for diner the following night.
Had the Gyro salad, with a side of falafels, and an appetizer of, I forget the name, but it was fried cheese, VERY good. The falafels were not dry, came with an delicious sauce and went well with the salad but would be great by itself too. Lots of people order salads there it seems, and their olive oil was extremely good.
Met the owner, who was very nice. He truly is a fat Greek :)  He's happy and takes pride in his restaurant.
I highly recommend The Fat Greek for lunch or diner!"
11,"Located right outside the strip next door to a food 4 less supermarket and fortunately right down the street from my place.
this Greeks is AWESOME! it's affordable, family owned, very nice people, and good quality food. the owner is really a fat greek lol and he's very nice.
you should give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
12,"This is my first yelp review. We went to The Fat Greek, based on the yelp reviews, and were not disappointed. This is a small restaurant in a strip mall.  The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. Large portions served by a charming staff.  Bright and clean is the best way to describe the ambiance. This is the best Greek food I've eaten in Vegas."
13,"Discovered this place a few years ago. Fell for the gyros instantly, over time, I've learned that the whole menu is great. I've been dozens of times and never been disappointed. Taken friends and family, it's always a hit.
Saganaki  & gyros are great for lunch, at dinner the combo plate is a great way to sample a variety, the lamb dishes are excellent, too. I'm also a fan of the lentil soup and pastries are treat if you are able to save room."
14,"Awesome! Great service, great food, great prices!"
15,"A solid 4 stars and maybe a little more. The staff, definitely imported, need to work on their friendliness a little bit. They did their jobs well but seemed a bit on the stiff side and need to liven up just a bit for this environment.
Wifey had a big salad with chicken that she liked. It was a Greek salad with calamata olives, feta and a few other traditional ingredients. I had the traditional gyro, no lettuce!, and it was very good. The fries with melted feta on them are outstanding! We'll definitely be going back when we're in the neighborhood."
16,"This restaurant has AWESOME customer service. We came in an hour before closing time and yet they still served us an awesome meal. Our waitress was awesome and had awesome manners too. Their hummus is fantastic. I had their pasta with shrimp and their shrimp were perfect. Their Fat Greek Salad is awesome too. All their seafood is fresh, literally. The cook goes out and buys it fresh or still alive...
Awesome place overall."
17,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is sooo good. The interior is delightfully homey, and the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly.
The gyro was incredible, although maybe not quite as good as the Bay Area's Opa's. The fries were some of the best I've had (crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside).
If we go back to Vegas we're definitely coming back to the Fat Greek."
18,"Nice Place! Good service (they were extremely patient with us and our baby). We had the Lavash wrap and the Falafel wrap and both of them were good & fresh tasting. The falafels were good, but not great.
The fries were the best. We would surely visit again."
19,Best Gyro in town. Great service and nice establishment.
20,"I was on the search for a good gyro for lunch and I brought along two of my friends for the journey. I like this place and the fact that when you walk in and its decorated with ""Greek colors."" I came here on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty packed. That was definitely a good sign! My friends both ordered the Fat Greek Gyro and I just ordered the Traditional Gyro. The Traditional Gyro was tasty, but I felt the pita bread was a bit too tough. The rice pilaf was good, but extremely buttery. My friend ordered the ""Greek"" fries and it came with melted feta cheese on top. It looked good, but I was too full to even try it. Overall, I think the lunch combo is decent deal and I will be back when I need a good gyro."
21,Im Greek & it's nice to see an actual restaurant in Vegas that represents are food so amazingly. The owner Yiannis is very friendly and anytime I walk in there i feel at home. Even if your not a fan of Greek food you cant pass up trying this place out from appetizer to desert you'll be amazed at how authentic it is!
22,"Love it! My favorite thing is whenever I'm in a bind for a potluck, I run over to these guys and grab two or three of their gyro salads. They're always a huge hit! Their homemade hummus is TO DIE FOR, and their steaks and lamb chops are always seasoned/cooked to perfection. It can be either very reasonable, or a little pricey, depending on what you order, but always worth it. The atmosphere is great... I've never been to Greece, but I totally felt like I was transported."
23,"Wonderful and amazing Greek food here.  Very authentic.  The atmosphere is light and airy.  It's got a full bar.  It's a great place to go to sit and chat over a great meal.  The food is reasonably priced for what you get (a gyro plate will feed me for two days).  The Chicken Lemon soup is absoultely amazing, as is the spiced feta.  Honestly, I've loved everything I've tried here.
The gyros are super popular.  If you hit a rush, you might wait for a while to get one.  However, it's always fresh, perfectly done, and cut from the spit as it's ordered (and often as it's done, thus the wait--which is WELL worth it).  Call ahead and order if you are in a rush.
The pastires are really not good for you, which is just as it should be.  The neopolitians are like eating clouds.  The baklava is inspiring, and the almond baklava is to die for.
I grew up in a small town that was heavy with Greek immigrants.  I grew to love the food.  I searched to find food to match it for years before finding this place.  It's wonderful."
24,"Maybe it was due to the outside temp being 115 and probably 85 in the restaurant, but there was an odd smell as soon as I walked in the door.
The decor was pleasing.  The service was very spotty.  Maybe the heat affected everyone there.
The food was good and I'd have given 4 stars except for the accompanying odor.  The gyro meat was plentiful - a little too plentiful.  Sometimes more isn't better.  The falafel was incredible.  Best I've had in Las Vegas."
25,"the best, period!"
26,"Wow. My  best friend and partner-in-dining out, Ana, raved about eating here, and I thought to finally go out with her and give this place a try; I didn't expect much, but I did trust my friends' assessment--I am definitely glad I did! The restaurant is tucked away in an urban shopping center, without any special banner or advertisement. I almost didn't find it, driving past it. The interior is very average Greek-restaurant--light blue and white--colors of the Greek flag are decorated inside. I will say that the place was extremely clean and meticulous, which I appreciated. The food pleasantly surprised me. My Greek salad was very flavorful. Pita bread was average. Babaghanoush was as good as it gets. Chicken shawarma was slightly above average--but very fresh. Deserts were too die for--great prices, too! I had Napolean--huge portion for only $3. Incredible.
I have some food allergies, and both, the waiter and the chef came out to discuss which foods had certain allergies etc. Very much appreciated!
Service was good, although it did take a lit...
